# Code_Refactor

## HTML Edits
Added title for the webpage.

Removed coding that was overruled by more specific sections (i.e. classes).

To properly direct the link in the header an "id" was added for "search-engine-optimization" in content section

Added descriptons for the images in the content and benefits sections.

Edited class name for content and benefit sections, allowing the repetitive CSS to be combined.


## CSS Edits
Replaced conflicting font style for ".header".

Combined list elements.

Combined "sub-content," "benefits," ".sub-benefits img." h2, and h3 sections.

Moved "sub-content" code to reflect the order of the html

Added notes in CSS file.
